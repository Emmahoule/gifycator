## Gifycator

* "With Gifycator, you can create your own story by gluing gifs together, and share them with your friends. Drop by the gallery, you might find something funny !" *

Gifycator is a web app to create a story with many gifs. It consists in 2 parts : **stories creation**, and **stories gallery**.

Using Lumen for back-end, ffmpeg for gif manipulation, and React.js for front-end.

My second application with React.js. School project, no tests, and back-end to improve.
